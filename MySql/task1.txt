step 1 => Create Databases
	Query => create Database Indew_Intern;

	o/p =>  OK, 1 row affected (0.05 sec)

step 2 => Use Database
	Query => use Indew_Intern

	o/p => Database changed

step 3 => Create Table
	Query => create table Employees(
		id INT PRIMARY KEY,
		name VARCHAR(100),
		department VARCHAR(100),
		salary float
	);

	o/p =>  OK, 1 row affected (0.05 sec)

step 4 => Describe Table
	Query => describe Employees;
	
	o/p=>	+------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
		| Field      | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
		+------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
		| Id         | int         | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
		| Name       | varchar(50) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
		| department | varchar(50) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
		| Salary     | float       | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
		+------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+

step 5 => Insert Data in Table
	Query => insert into Employees(id,name,department,salary) 
			VALUES(1,'Harshit','MERN STACK',2.40);
	o/p =>  OK, 1 row affected (0.05 sec)
	
step 6 => display all records
	Query => select * from Employees;
	
	o/p =>	+----+---------+------------+--------+
		| Id | Name    | department | Salary |
		+----+---------+------------+--------+
		|  1 | Harshit | MERN STACK |    2.4 |
		|  2 | Kanita  | MERN STACK |    2.4 |
		|  3 | Aditya  | MERN STACK | 300000 |
		+----+---------+------------+--------+

step 7 => Update one record's salary 	
	Query =>  update Employees set salary=400000 where id =1;

	o/p => 	Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)
		Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

step 8 => delete a Record 
	Query => delete from Employees where id=3;
	
	o/p => Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)

Step 9 => After All Operation Table is =>
	
	o/p =>	+----+---------+------------+--------+
		| Id | Name    | department | Salary |
		+----+---------+------------+--------+
		|  1 | Harshit | MERN STACK | 400000 |
		|  2 | Kanita  | MERN STACK |    2.4 |
